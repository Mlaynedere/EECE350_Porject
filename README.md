# EECE350_Project
In this repository, we submit the project assigned in EECE 350.
The team is comprised of Dany Solh, Lana Noura, Ala√¢ Khanafer, and Hussein Mallah.
In order to play the game you have to run the server code in a CLI window first and then the client codes in 3 different CLI windows, in each one you start a client code and you emulate a player in the game.
Note that, if you're using the regular Command Prompt on your Windows machine, there is a chance that the windows close early before displaying the results and the winner, so it is recommended to use PowerShell.
Another note, we included music while playing the game, so for the sake of recording the demo we commented the line out.
Bear in mind, the path of the song in the server code is unique to my machine, so if you want to play the music correctly change the path to your's.
Hope you enjoy and have fun!
